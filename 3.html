<h2>Javascript</h2>
<p>
  (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a pro
  gramming language that is one of the core technologies
   of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As
    of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the clie
    nt side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporati
    ng third-party libraries.[13] All major web browser
    s have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the
     code on users' devices.

  JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compile
  d language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[
  14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-ori
  entation, and first-class functions. It is multi-parad
  igm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperat
  ive programming styles. It has application programmin
  g interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, reg
  lar expressions, standard data structures, and the Do
  cument Object Model (DOM).
